						<h1>A bit about me</h1>
						<p>
							I was born in Vancouver in 1999 and moved to the UK in 2004. After completing my computer science degree in the UK I wanted to move back to Vancouver and find a job to improve my skills through work. I have a place to stay in Vancouver and a Canadian social insurance number.
						</p>
						<p>
							I finished my degree in summer 2022 and I am very eager to get started doing an interesting job that can push my knowledge further. I always enjoyed taking on the work that others in group projects did not want to do as it would pose a challenge and allow me to increase my coding skills.

								The aim was to create a spelling test platform aimed at dyslexic children. The solution I created was a web application using PHP to allow parents or teachers to create online spelling tests for students or children.
							</p>
							<p>
								All spelling test results were stored on an SQL database in JSON formatting. As a teacher or parent you can see the results of each student/child taking your tests while logged in. The information is displayed as an infographic or as text information. Within this screen you can see a history of which words the student has gotten wrong or correct.
							</p>
							<p>
								Research was done into font styles, colors and spacing to enable children or students using the platform to select from a list of options which style helps them read the letters best.
							</p>
							<p>
								A Google text-to-speech API was used during the actual test which would read out the word from the test to the user. As a teacher you are able to set the accent of the API to whichever option they think is easiest to understand.
							</p>
							<p>
								A main feature of this application was the ability to autogenerate spelling tests based on the UK government guidelines for spelling by age. As a teacher or parent you can select topics by year or down to the letter order/ sound.
							</p>
							<p>
								e.g. the “-oo” sound or “-ism” word ending or “year 2”
